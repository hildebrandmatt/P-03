            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>The Tuxedo Cat found its humble beginnings as a small bar in the cozy corner of Meownicipal Avenue, where we served late-night patrons with the company of our resident cat, Sherbert. Sherbert's company was delightful for many of our regular patrons- he kept them company and helped them de-stress after a long day.</p>
            <p>Thus, the idea for the Tuxedo Cat bar and lounge came to fruition. With your support, we found our home in a bigger space next to our beginning location. Now we have more cats then ever!</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>We want to provide a space where folks can come in and relax. There's a lot of stress out there, and in our experience few things help more than a good stiff drink, and a nice warm cat.</p>
            <p>There are also a lot of cats out there looking for a loving home. We're happy to take in as many as we can, and give them a safe and fun temporary home. But really they need you, and we're hoping that you'll come in, fall in love with one of our lovable rascals, and take them home with you.</p>

            <h3>Our Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>In the 3 short years The Tuxedo Cat has been open, we've given 276 kitties a loving home. That's a lot!</p>
            <p>We've also served thousands of patrons who've passed through our doors and helped them find bonds with our lovable kitties.</p>
